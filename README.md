Hello World!

My name is Bartek. I am here to learn some Java and other usefull thigns needed to become a Java Developer :)
I used to be a constructor/technologist, but in production industry, so it's quite new for me to write a code, but I already like it :)
I like sport ( mostly football, boxing, surfing and poker ) and computer games ( mostly strategy and tactics games, but not only ).
